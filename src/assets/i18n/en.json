    "Description": "My name is József Kismarczi and I have been involved in active development since 2018. My skills include the implementation of web design and development principles to create reliable software both on the backend and front-end. I bring mockups to life using a variety of tools, such as HTML5, CSS3, SCSS, JavaScript (ES6), TypeScript, jQuery and Angular. I am able to communicate technical issues clearly and comprehensibly to the development team. I create responsive and user-friendly products and applications, then monitor their performance and solve problems. I use version control tools like Git to maintain an organized workflow. I Also I have experience in using the .net framework. On the back-end, I also try to comply with SOLID principles, clean code rules and using design patterns to create a WEB API with better performance and more transparent code."
